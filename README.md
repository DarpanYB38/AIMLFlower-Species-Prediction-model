# AIMLFlower-Species-Prediction-model
Its a Machine Learning Project to Predict a Flowers particular Species type using its length and width of the pettals it uses the knn algorithm

# Caution 
Its just a simple model of machine learning to preidict a paticular flowers Species type using the already existng dataset, its suggested to use at the college levels mini project type not the industry level project.
This is done using python(django) at the backend and the html with bootstartp at the front end and the models in side the python 

# Mandatory Need to have in your system 
First you have to install latest version of Python from the python's official website 

After Setting up the python you can download vs code its optional i suggest the vs only of the code editting purpose 

# How to Run ## This will work for both windows as well as linux based systems like ubuntu
* iris.csv file is the dataset which is been trained for the Machine.
* Install the django form your command Prompt
  by using the following command
  pip install django

* You have to install the sklearn to run these ML projects because this carries all the ML algorithms in it 
    by using
    pip install scikit-learn

* Then at last you have to install the pandas to read the data from the dataset provided in the project by using
      pip install pandas

* then clone this repo or Download .zip file and run your project form the command prompt only by using this command
        python manage.py runserver

* Then the server will start copy the url like this 127.0.0.1.8000 and copy & past it to the any of the browser you choose
* The simple Project will be Displaying

# If You have Anaconda Installed in your system then no need to install these packags execpt Python and django
