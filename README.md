# AIMLFlower-Species-Prediction-model
Its a Machine Learning Project to Predict a Flowers particular Species type using its length and width of the pettals it uses the knn algorithm<br>

# Caution 
Its just a simple model of machine learning to preidict a paticular flowers Species type using the already existng dataset, its suggested to use at the college levels mini project type not the industry level project.<br>
This is done using python(django) at the backend and the html with bootstartp at the front end and the models in side the python <br>

# Mandatory Need to have in your system 
First you have to install latest version of Python from the python's official website <br>

After Setting up the python you can download vs code its optional i suggest the vs only of the code editting purpose <br>

# How to Run ## This will work for both windows as well as linux based systems like ubuntu
* iris.csv file is the dataset which is been trained for the Machine.<br>
* Install the django form your command Prompt<br>
  by using the following command<br>
  ***
  pip install django
  ***
* You have to install the sklearn to run these ML projects because this carries all the ML algorithms in it<br>
    by using<br>
    pip install scikit-learn<br>

* Then at last you have to install the pandas to read the data from the dataset provided in the project by using<br>
      pip install pandas<br>

* then clone this repo or Download .zip file and run your project form the command prompt only by using this command<br>
        python manage.py runserver<br>

* Then the server will start copy the url like this 127.0.0.1.8000 and copy & past it to the any of the browser you choose<br>
* The simple Project will be Displaying<br>

# If You have Anaconda Installed in your system then no need to install these packags execpt Python and django
If u have Ananconda Also You need Python & django On your System to run this project.
